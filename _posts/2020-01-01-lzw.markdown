## Context

If you examine a text file character by character or look at an image file pixel by pixel, you’ll probably start noticing repeating patterns. Lempel Ziv Welch (LZW), published in 1984 by Albraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, and Terry Welch, is a lossless compression algorithm that takes advantage of recurring patterns found in data to reduce file size. The algorithm is lossless, meaning the exact original data can be reconstructed from the compressed version. It is also adaptive and updates its compression model as it processes more data, allowing compression to become more and more efficient.

LZW can be applied to any file type and can be implemented in both software and hardware. Software applications of LZW include the GIF image format, TIFF image format, and Unix file compression utility compress. In the hardware world, LZW is used notably in wifi modems. 

LZW is also closely related to a few other common compression algorithms, namely, it’s predecessors LZ77 and LZ78, and the deflate/zlib. Deflate/zlib is a combination between a LZ77 variant and Huffman encoding, and is responsible for zip, png, pdf file types.

## Overview

The LZW algorithm works by representing strings of symbols(substrings) with integer codes. Since the integer codes take up less space than the substrings in most scenarios, we achieve compression. LZW utilizes a code dictionary to store the integer codes and the substrings they are associated with. Rather than using a predefined dictionary like some data compression algorithms, LZW is adaptive and builds the dictionary as it processes the input data. 

We start encoding at the beginning of the input and process one character (typically 8 bits) at a time. Throughout the encoding process, we will refer to and update the code dictionary and a variable that keeps track of the substring we’re currently processing. 

If the substring we’re currently processing exists in the dictionary, the algorithm takes the next character from input. We update the current substring by adding the new character to the end and checking whether the updated substring is in the code dictionary. We continue this process of adding a new character and checking the dictionary until we find a substring that is not in the dictionary, in other words, a substring that has not been encountered before. 

There are several steps to take to process a substring that has not been previously seen. First, add the substring to the code dictionary. Second, take the code that corresponds to the previously seen portion of the substring, which is just the substring without the last character, and write it to the output. Finally, we set the substring we’re currently processing to its last character.

We then feed in the next character from input and continue the process described in the above two paragraphs until the input is exhausted. A block diagram of the algorithm is shown below.

Since LZW only requires a single pass of the data, it scales linearly and can be described in Big O notation as having O(n) time complexity. 

## Algorithm

Let’s go through an example where we use LZW to compress the string “babaa”. 

The first thing we need to do is to create and initialize the code dictionary. 

![lzw dictionary]({{"/assets/images/LZW/dict.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: style="width:350px; float:left; margin:20px 40px"}

For our dictionary, the indexes are the codes and the values at each index are the substrings. The dictionary typically holds a max of 4096 entries to ensure the LZW algorithm doesn’t use up too much memory. Additionally, the first 256 entries of the dictionary are preassigned to represent single byte ASCII characters (e.g. ‘j’, ‘a’, etc.), and serve as “base cases” to get the algorithm started. Each character takes up 8 bits and each code takes up 12 bits.

Before we jump into processing the input, it’s worth mentioning this quick note about diagramming:

The purple highlight signifies that these characters have been processed with LZW and are present in the output. The pink highlight indicates the substring that is currently being processed. Characters that are not highlighted have not been fed into the algorithm. 

Alright, let's get started with encoding the string “babaa”

![step 1]({{"/assets/images/LZW/1.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: style="width:200px; float:left; margin:20px 120px"}

We start at the beginning of the string and set the current substring to “b”. Since b exists in the dictionary, we feed in another character from input. 

![step 2]({{"/assets/images/LZW/2_lookup.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: style="width:400px; float:left; margin:0px 20px"}

<br>

The current substring is “ba”. Since “ba” does not exist in the dictionary, we add it to the dictionary so that it corresponds to the next available code. 

<br>

![step 3]({{"/assets/images/LZW/2_write.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: style="width:400px; float:left; margin:60px 20px"}

We then take “b”, the longest section of “ba” that exists in the dictionary, and write the code associated with it to output. We also set the current substring to “a”, the last character of “ba”, and feed in another character. 

![step 4]({{"/assets/images/LZW/3_lookup.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: style="width:400px; float:left; margin:0px 20px"}

<br>

The current substring becomes “ab”. Since “ab” does not exist in the dictionary, similar as before, we add it to the dictionary to the next available code. 

<br>

![step 5]({{"/assets/images/LZW/3_write.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: style="width:400px; float:left; margin:60px 20px"}

We take “a”, the longest section of “ab” that’s in the dictionary, and write its code to output. We then set the current substring to “b”, the last character of “ab”, and feed in the next character from input. 

![step 6]({{"/assets/images/LZW/4.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: style="width:200px; float:left; margin:40px 120px"}

<br>

The current substring is “ba”. Since “ba” exists in the dictionary, we feed in another character from input. 

<br>

![step 7]({{"/assets/images/LZW/5_lookup.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: style="width:400px; float:left; margin:0px 20px"}

<br>

The current substring updates to “baa”. Since “baa” does not exist in the dictionary, we add it to the dictionary to the next available code. 

<br>

![step 8]({{"/assets/images/LZW/5_write.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: style="width:400px; float:left; margin:80px 20px"}

<br>

We take “ba”, the longest section of “baa” that’s in the dictionary, and write its code to output. We also set the current substring to “a”, the last character of “baa”. Note that we’ve exhausted our input.

<br>

![step 9]({{"/assets/images/LZW/6_write.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){: style="width:400px; float:left; margin:20px 20px"}

Since there are no more characters left from input to feed in, we simply output the code of “a” to finish encoding. 

<br>

So did this process compress “babaa”? Let’s do some math: 

- We started with a 5 character input and each character takes up 8 bits, giving us 5\*8 = 40 bits of input.
- We ended up with a 4 code output and each code takes up 12 bits, giving us 4\*12 = 48 bits of output. 

Our findings show that the encoded output actually takes more space than the input for “babaa”! You may be wondering, if this process is meant to reduce memory, why didn’t it work? LZW couldn’t compress “babaa” because although the string contained repetition, it was too short for LZW to build a effective dictionary model. Since LZW capitalizes on patterns and updates its model as it goes, it works best on large repetitive files like text or image. As the substrings that get added to the dictionary get progressively longer, LZW yields better compression rates.
